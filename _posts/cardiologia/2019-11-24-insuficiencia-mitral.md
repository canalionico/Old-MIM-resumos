The papillary muscles: there are two dominant papillary
muscles, one anterolateral and the other posteromedial.
The posteromedial papillary muscle has a single blood
supply usually from the posterior descending artery, while
the anterolateral papillary muscle is usually supplied by
both the left anterior descending artery and left circumflex
artery.[^Harb2019]
