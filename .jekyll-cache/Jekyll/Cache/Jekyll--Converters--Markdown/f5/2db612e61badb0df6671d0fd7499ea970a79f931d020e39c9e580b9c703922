<p>The cell wall of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria is composed of peptidoglycan, which allows cells to contain and resist high osmotic pressure.</p>

<p>The cell wall of gram-positive bacteria is a
substantial layer 50 to 100 molecules in thickness, whereas in gram-
negative bacteria it is only one or two molecules thick.</p>

<p>An outer mem-
brane lipopolysaccharide layer, not found in gram-positive bacteria, is
present in gram-negative species. The basic subunit of the peptidogly-
can component is a disaccharide monomer of N-acetylglucosamine
(NAG, or GlcNAc) and N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM, or MurNAc)
pentapeptide (Fig. 20-2).</p>
